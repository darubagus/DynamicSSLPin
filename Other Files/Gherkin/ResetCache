Feature: Resetting Cached Data
  As a developer
  I want to reset cached data for a specific instance
  So that I can clear the cached data and remove it from the secure data store

Scenario: Resetting cached data when data is cached
  Given there is cached data for the instance with ID "INSTANCE_ID"
  When the developer resets the cached data
  Then the cached data is set to null
  And the data associated with the instance ID is removed from the secure data store
