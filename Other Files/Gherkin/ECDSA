Feature: ECDSA Signature Validation
  As a developer
  I want to validate ECDSA signatures using public keys
  So that I can determine whether a signature is valid for a given data

Scenario: Validating a valid ECDSA signature
  Given a signed data with a valid ECDSA signature
  And a valid ECDSA public key
  When the developer validates the ECDSA signature
  Then the signature is valid

Scenario: Validating an invalid ECDSA signature
  Given a signed data with an invalid ECDSA signature
  And a valid ECDSA public key
  When the developer validates the ECDSA signature
  Then the signature is not valid

Scenario: Validating with an incorrect public key
  Given a signed data with a valid ECDSA signature
  And an incorrect ECDSA public key
  When the developer validates the ECDSA signature
  Then the signature is not valid

Scenario: Validating with different data
  Given a signed data with a valid ECDSA signature
  And a valid ECDSA public key
  And a different data than the signed data
  When the developer validates the ECDSA signature
  Then the signature is not valid
