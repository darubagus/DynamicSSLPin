Feature: Certificate Sorting
  As a developer
  I want to sort a list of certificates based on common name and expiration date
  So that I can display them in an organized manner

Scenario: Sorting certificates with different common names
  Given a list of certificates with different common names and expiration dates
  When the developer sorts the certificates
  Then the certificates are sorted in ascending order based on common name
  And certificates with the same common name are further sorted in descending order based on expiration date

Scenario: Sorting certificates with the same common name
  Given a list of certificates with the same common name and different expiration dates
  When the developer sorts the certificates
  Then the certificates are sorted in descending order based on expiration date

Scenario: Sorting an empty list of certificates
  Given an empty list of certificates
  When the developer sorts the certificates
  Then the list remains empty
