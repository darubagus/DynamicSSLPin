Feature: Data Hashing
  As a developer
  I want to hash data using the SHA-256 algorithm
  So that I can ensure data integrity and security

Scenario: Hashing data using SHA-256
  Given the developer has some data
  When the developer hashes the data using SHA-256
  Then a SHA-256 digest is calculated for the data
  And the calculated digest is converted to a Data object
