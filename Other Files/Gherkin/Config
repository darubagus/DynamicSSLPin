Feature: Certificate Store Initialization
  As a developer
  I want to initialize a certificate store with a service URL and public key
  So that I can use the certificate store for secure communications

Scenario: Initializing certificate store with valid service URL and public key
  Given the service URL is "https://example.com"
  And the public key is "PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENT"
  When the developer initializes a certificate store with the service URL and public key
  Then the service URL is successfully parsed
  And a valid configuration is created with the parsed URL and public key
  And the certificate store is integrated using the created configuration

Scenario: Initializing certificate store with invalid service URL
  Given the service URL is "invalid-url"
  And the public key is "PUBLIC_KEY_CONTENT"
  When the developer initializes a certificate store with the service URL and public key
  Then the service URL parsing fails
  And an invalid URL result is reported through the handshake listener

Scenario: Initializing certificate store with missing public key
  Given the service URL is "https://example.com"
  And the public key is missing
  When the developer initializes a certificate store with the service URL and public key
  Then the service URL is successfully parsed
  And a valid configuration is created with the parsed URL
  And the certificate store is integrated using the created configuration
